I successfully built the computer from the starter kit and installed some software including VS Code. Ran it in desktop mode. It is reasonably performant. 

Next I may try and run WebPageTest or SiteSpeed on it!

## Update: According to one of the contributors to sitespeed it works on a Raspberry Pi 5 to run with Android phones.
