The first test I ran with WebPageTest was *Dec 07, 2022 5:14:31 AM UTC	Virginia USA - EC2 - Chrome - Emulated Motorola G (gen 4) - 4G*.


According to WebPageTest I have ran _**570+**_ URLs, each time for multiple runs of the test, so likely triple that or more runs of WebPageTest. I think this makes me a power user of the .org website as an individual manually running tests. I was so proud one time to fix a typo in documentation as an open source contribution to the project:

**WebPageTest is an incredible piece of engineering...** I even bought their T-Shirt with their vintage logo.
