The web is great and good but I have been working to consolidate my online digital footprint.

This has included archiving or closing dozens of cumulative things, such as GitHub projects, Netlify sites, Glitch projects and Replit instances, and DigitalOcean droplets.

This website survives the initial consolidation, but it is not necessarily going to last.
