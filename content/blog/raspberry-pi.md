For an early birthday gift I received a CanaKit Raspberry Pi 5 Starter Kit.

I have had small extra computers before and while they were great I have not put one into a specific use case that has made a particular lasting impact.

However, I am full of optimism! 

* Use it in conjunction with a music sampler I have called an EP-133
* Use it with writing apps to create a separate working environment for fewer distractions

Currently working on more ideas. Excited.
